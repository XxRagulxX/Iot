## Steps for IoT Penetration Testing

### 1. Information Gathering
- **Device Information:** Identify device model, version, and manufacturer.
- **Network Scanning:** Use tools like Nmap and Wireshark to analyze device communication and open ports.

### 2. Firmware Analysis
- **Firmware Extraction:** Download or extract firmware using binwalk.
- **Reverse Engineering:** Use Ghidra or IDA Pro to analyze for vulnerabilities.

### 3. Hardware Analysis
- **Interface Identification:** Locate JTAG/UART interfaces using a multimeter or logic analyzer.
- **Device Access:** Use Bus Pirate or FTDI cables to connect to hardware and gain shell access.

### 4. Network and Communication Testing
- **Traffic Analysis:** Capture and analyze network traffic with Wireshark.
- **Traffic Manipulation:** Use Burp Suite or mitmproxy to manipulate device communication.

### 5. Web Interface and Mobile App Testing
- **Web Application:** Test web apps for vulnerabilities like SQLi, XSS.
- **Mobile Application:** Reverse engineer mobile apps using APKTool to check for insecure practices.

### 6. Wireless Communication Testing
- **Wi-Fi:** Test for weak Wi-Fi encryption (e.g., WPA2 cracking).
- **Bluetooth/ZigBee:** Test wireless protocols for weak pairing or data leakage.

### 7. Post-Exploitation
- **Privilege Escalation:** Test for escalating access levels (e.g., user to root).
- **Persistence:** Check for methods to retain control after reboot.

### 8. Reporting and Recommendations
- **Risk Prioritization:** Classify vulnerabilities by severity (High, Medium, Low).
- **Remediation:** Provide recommendations for fixing identified issues.
